# Supply Chain Risk Management Guideline

Agencies should review [ACSC's Questions to Ask Managed Service Providers](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/outsourcing-and-procurement/managed-services/questions-ask-managed-service-providers), especially service providers managing their **network**, **compute** and **file/email (Microsoft 365)** resources. A supporting extract from page 16 and 17 of the [NIST CSF 2.0 Initial Public Draft](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.ipd.pdf) is below, identifying what should be addressed as part of procurement and **contract management**.

!!! note "Managing Cybersecurity Risk in Supply Chains (NIST)"

    - **Identify:** Identifying, validating, and recording vulnerabilities associated with the supplier’s product or service [ID.RA-01]
    - **Protect:** Authenticating users, services, and hardware [PR.AA-03]; applying appropriate configuration management practices [PR.PS-01]; generating log records and having the logs available for continuous monitoring [PR.PS-04]; and integrating secure software development practices into the supplier’s software development life cycles [PR.PS-07]
    - **Detect:** Monitoring computing hardware and software for potentially adverse events [DE.CM-09]
    - **Respond:** Executing incident response plans when compromised products or services are involved [RS.MA-01]
    - **Recover:** Executing the recovery portion of the organization’s incident response plan when compromised products or services are involved [RC.RP-01], and restoring compromised products or services and verifying their integrity [RC.RP-05]
